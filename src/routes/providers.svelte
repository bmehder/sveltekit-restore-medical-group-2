  <p>
    Whether you have a patient that needs a wound care referral or if you are a
    current wound care provider who has a patient who has not responded to the
    treatment you have provided so far, please consider us as a resource for
    healing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Your patients look to you as their contact for help across the board.
    Consider us as a resource that you can confidently recommend to deal with
    chronic wounds. We are not looking to replace the care you provide but to
    augment your service for more stubborn situations. We will work under your
    guidance if you would like to take the lead or you can turn the very
    specific work we do over to us completely, knowing that we will keep you
    informed every step along the way.
  </p>

  <p>
    We always provide an evaluation up front to make sure the patient is a good
    candidate for the Restore process. We also make sure insurance is
    pre-authorized so there are no surprises. For those that qualify, we have
    found that the process is not long and drawn out but provides healing at
    around 21 days or within several months. Every patient is different of
    course. Once the major part of our work is done your patient is yours again
    for follow up and to continue under your care.
  </p>

  <p>
    We are actively looking for partners to help us with patients who have
    struggled in the past.
