  <h4>Frustrated by a chronic wound?</h4>

  <p>
    Wounds can be created many ways; surgery, injury, Diabetes, pressure, even
    blood clots can lead to surface wounds. Other factors can complicate
    treatment from medication to radiation treatment or circulation problems.
    Even what looks like a simple wound can become a serious (not to mention
    painful!) issue.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are many treatment options for wounds and Restore Medical Group will
    work with you to provide the best option for care. Serious wounds can make
    it difficult to get around and so we offer multiple clinics along the Front
    Range as well as the option of traveling to the facility where you are or
    even your home.
  </p>
  <p>
    We specialize in treating chronic wounds with the Restore process that could
    include the use of amnio products. These products use your own tissue to
    create new skin and have proven very effective even on people who have been
    treated with more conventional wound practices.
  </p>
  <p>
    Donâ€™t give up! This process has been approved by many insurance groups as
    well as Medicare Part B. What was once cost-prohibitive is now within the
    reach of many.
